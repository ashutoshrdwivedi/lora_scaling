"""Tests for the mixed-rank padding path used by the mixed-rank benchmark.

The mixed-rank result rests on one identity: zero-padding a rank-r adapter into
a rank-r_max slot changes the batch's SHAPE but not its VALUE, so a mixed-rank
batch is the same computation as a uniform r_max batch. The benchmark asserts
that on-device before it times anything; these tests pin the same identity on
CPU, where it is exact in fp32 and costs no GPU time to check.

They also cover the two ways the padding can silently go wrong:
  - drawing weights into a strided slice instead of a contiguous tensor, which
    would make "the same adapter at rank r" mean different weights in different
    arms (test_padded_store_matches_native_draw);
  - reusing a batch buffer without re-padding, which leaves the previous
    occupant's high-rank columns behind (test_no_stale_weights_across_batches).
