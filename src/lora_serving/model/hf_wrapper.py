"""Batched multi-tenant LoRA on a stock HuggingFace encoder via forward hooks.

`EncoderWithLora` (encoder.py) reimplements the BERT-family forward, so it only
serves checkpoints whose state dict matches that architecture exactly. This
module takes the opposite approach for everything else: run the unmodified HF
model (`AutoModel`) and inject the same per-sample late-fusion delta
    y = W0·x + B_i·A_i·x
through forward hooks on the target projection Linears. The base architecture
is HF's own code — disentangled attention, convolutions, pre-LN variants all
come for free — while the LoRA path stays the identical batched-BMM
decomposition used everywhere else in this repo.

The AdapterStore / BatchAssembler / LRHeadOps pipeline is shared with
EncoderWithLora; only the base forward differs.
