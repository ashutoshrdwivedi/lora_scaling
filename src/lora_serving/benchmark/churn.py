"""Adapter-registration churn microbenchmark (reviewer yeZ9, Q6).

The question asked is whether the O(N^2)-vs-O(1) cold-start result translates
to production impact -- "what % of serving time is spent in adapter
registration under realistic churn rates?".  Answering it needs three things
the existing ``lora_serving.benchmark.run --churn`` path does not provide.

**1. Registration has to be the production path.**  The number the rebuttal
quotes today (0.29 ms/adapter) comes from ``adapter_load_total_s / N`` on the
startup preload, i.e. from :meth:`AdapterStore.load_synthetic` -- a
``torch.manual_seed`` + ``nn.init.normal_`` loop that generates random weights
on the GPU with curand.  It reads no file and performs no host-to-device copy,
so it cannot back the sentence "registration is an O(1) memcpy".  The shipped
registration path is :meth:`AdapterStore.load_from_file`, which
``deploy/server/app.py`` names in the comment beside its synthetic stub and
which ``deploy/server/reload.py`` feeds from S3.  That is what ``--registration
-path file`` measures.  ``synthetic`` is kept as an ablation arm so the gap
between the two is reported rather than silently inherited.

**2. Churn rate has to be an independent variable.**  In the older harness the
churn rate was an emergent byproduct of (Zipf alpha, tenant count, capacity),
which meant defending a particular alpha over a particular tenant population as
"realistic".  Here admissions are driven directly at a target rate, so a reader
maps their own workload onto the axis instead of onto our alpha.

Note this makes the request stream's hit rate uninteresting by construction:
requests always draw from the *current* resident pool, so every request hits and
no hit/miss metric is collected.  Zipf alpha shapes only which resident adapters
are popular, and since replacement walks slots round-robin rather than by
popularity, alpha has little influence on the result at all.

The churn model is pool *replacement*, not demand paging: at the target rate a
resident adapter is evicted and a fresh one registered in its place, while the
request stream draws Zipf over the resident pool.  That matches the deployment
in ``deploy/server/reload.py`` -- adapters are hot-reloaded on a Redis
notification when a tenant retrains, they are not faulted in on a request miss.

**3. Eviction and registration have to be billed together.**  ``evict()`` is a
``del``, so it returns the block to the caching allocator and looks nearly
free, while the real cost resurfaces in the next allocation and gets billed to
registration.  Measuring the two separately is what produced a cost curve that
was non-monotonic in the driving variable (72.7 ms/admission at N=20k/B=32
against 7.1 ms at N=20k/B=64, which has twice the misses).  The headline unit
here is therefore one *replacement* = evict + register, with the two also
reported separately for diagnosis.
