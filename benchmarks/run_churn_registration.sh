# Answers "what % of serving time is spent in adapter registration under
# realistic churn rates" with the registration path the server actually uses
# (AdapterStore.load_from_file, fed from S3 by deploy/server/reload.py) rather
# than the synthetic-weight generator the current 0.29 ms/adapter figure is
# derived from.
#
# Four phases, ~50 min total on an A100-80GB. Each writes its own CSV: one file
# per logical result, so a phase can be re-run without disturbing the others.
