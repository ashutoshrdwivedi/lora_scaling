"""Does Finding 1's flat-in-N latency survive a MIXED-RANK fleet?

Reviewer question this answers: "Fig 3 shows latency flat as N scales — does
this hold under mixed-rank deployments (e.g. some adapters r=4, others r=16 in
the same batch)?", and the paired weakness "padding every adapter to the max
rank in the batch wastes compute on low-rank adapters; the overhead is
potentially severe".

The paper's serving path is uniform-rank: `LoraServingConfig.lora_rank` is a
scalar, so every adapter in the store — and every slot in the (B, H, r) /
(B, r, H) batch tensors — has the same r. Serving a heterogeneous fleet means
zero-padding each tenant's A columns / B rows out to the batch's maximum rank.
That padding is *numerically exact* (the padded components multiply zero rows,
contributing nothing) and it makes the batch tensors bit-identically shaped to a
uniform-r_max batch, so the padded mixed batch runs the same kernels with the
same FLOPs as the uniform max-rank batch the paper already measures. This
benchmark is the empirical version of that argument.

Arms, at each (N, B):

  uniform_r{min}      every tenant at the fleet's LOWEST rank, no padding.
                      The "what if nobody forced padding" reference — the cost
                      a low-rank tenant would pay in a homogeneous deployment.
  uniform_r{max}      every tenant at the fleet's HIGHEST rank. The cost of the
                      padded batch's SHAPE.
  mixed_*_padded      heterogeneous native ranks, stored pre-padded to r_max,
                      gathered with the ordinary index_select assembler. The
                      simplest deployment: pad once at load time.
  mixed_*_native      the same fleet stored at NATIVE rank (one packed tensor
                      per rank bucket), zero-padded into the batch buffer at
                      gather time. Memory-optimal: the store pays for mean rank,
                      only the transient batch tensor pays for max rank.

Two ratios come out of that, and they are the answer:

  padding tax        mixed / uniform_r{min} — what a low-rank tenant actually
                     pays for sharing a batch with high-rank tenants.
  shape overhead     mixed / uniform_r{max} — whether a mixed batch costs
                     anything BEYOND its padded shape. Should be ~0; a non-zero
                     value means the gather, not the math, is the cost.

Before any timing, an exactness gate asserts that a low-rank tenant served
zero-padded inside an r_max batch produces the same logits as the same tenant
served natively in an r_min batch, and that the two mixed implementations agree.
The reported max|Δlogit| is the parity number to quote.

Unlike `lora_serving.benchmark.synthetic`, adapters here are drawn with a
NON-ZERO B matrix. The shared helper zeroes B (making delta=0, which is safe for
its own correctness checks but would make this benchmark's exactness gate
vacuous — every arm would agree on a delta of zero). Shapes and kernels are
identical either way, so timing is unaffected.

    Check 1 (the load-bearing one): take tenants whose NATIVE rank is r_min and
    serve them two ways — natively in an r_min batch, and zero-padded inside an
    r_max batch. Same weights by construction (same seed, same native shape), so
    identical logits is the claim that "pad-to-max is exact" rests on.

    Check 1 runs in fp32, NOT in the run's serving dtype, and that distinction
    is the whole reason this docstring is long. The identity being asserted is
    algebraic — the padded components multiply zero rows, so they contribute
    nothing — and in fp32 it holds bit-exactly on-device (measured 0.0e+00, not
    merely inside a tolerance). In fp16 it does not, and not because padding is
    wrong: the native check runs an (H x 4) GEMM where the padded one runs an
    (H x 16), cuBLAS picks its tiling and split-k from that shape, and the two
    therefore accumulate the same products in different orders. One layer's
    delta moves by ~3e-5 against a delta of scale ~1e-2 (0.3%, i.e. fp16
    rounding), but bge-m3 restacks that through 24 layers of attention and the
    logits end up ~7% apart — 8e-1 absolute against a mean |logit| near 11.
    Gating THAT at 1e-3 measures the stability of fp16 accumulation across two
    GEMM shapes, which is not what this benchmark is about and which no correct
    implementation could pass. The serving-dtype divergence is still measured
    and reported below (`..._serving_dtype`), because it is a real property of
    a mixed-rank fleet that a rebuttal should quote rather than hide: padding a
    tenant to r_max in fp16 perturbs its logits at the same order as any other
    change of batch composition or cuBLAS version. It does not touch the timing
    arms, whose shapes, kernels and FLOP counts are identical either way.

    Checks 2 and 3 stay in the serving dtype. They compare LAYOUTS at one fixed
    slot rank — pre-padded store vs pad-at-gather, and the in-place packed
    builder vs the shipped IndexSelectBatchAssembler — so they are pure data
    movement into identically shaped buffers, with no GEMM shape change to
    re-associate anything. They are exact in fp16 and are asserted as such.
